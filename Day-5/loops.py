#SO Loops 

#there are two types of loops in python
# 1) For Loops 
# 2) While Loops

# For Loops 
# For loops are useful in many cases but they are mainly used with lists
# SO lets say you have a list of some fruits
fruits = ["Apple", "Strawberry", "Mango", "Orange", "Banana"]
#now lets say you want to print every one of these seprately with pie wrriten after them
# so now we write a for loop to do that
for pie in fruits:
    print(pie + " Pie")
# now lets say you want to apply a condition that if its a strawberyy pie print $3.19
# So we do that like this
    if pie == "Strawberry":
        print(3.19)
    else:
        print(10.5)


# SO basically this is for loops.
