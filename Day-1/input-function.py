# So the input function can be used to take a input from the client's side

# But while taking the input you will have to store it somewhere like in variables
# Like this

name = input("What is your name ")

# then you can use this input to do a lot of this like this

print("Hello " + name)

# or instead of storing the input in variables we can also do this 

print("Hello " + input("What is your name "))
