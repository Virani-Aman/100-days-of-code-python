# So lets say you have created a program or something and you need to perform the same multiple task multiple times
# And because of which your code looks like junk to make your work easier and your code more readable we define functions like this 

def my_function():
    print("Dance")
    print("bale bale")
    print("I am batman")

my_function()

# while loops while loops are just like for loops but they perform a task while its true or false like

number = 10

while number != 0:
    my_function()
    number -= 1
    print(number)
