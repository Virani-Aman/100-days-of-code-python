# Mathematical operators (Arithmetic Operators)
# They are the operators which can be used to perform mathematical equations
# here are the most common mathematical operators -

# + operator (Addition Operator)
# - operator (Subtraction Operator)
# * operator (Multiplication Operator)
# / operator (Division Operator) (Tip this will return in a float type)
# % operator (Modulus Operator) (divides two numbers and returns the remainder)
# ** operator (Exponent Operator)


# Now also if there are multiple equations in one line like this:
# 1 + 2 * 2 / 3 + 4
# so in which order will this equation be performed,
# so they will be in the order of PEMDAS

# PEMDAS full form
# Parenthesis
# Exponent
# Multiplication
# Division
# Addition
# Subtraction
